print(10 / 3) # Prints the value as it is
print(10 // 3) # Truncates the value to int
print(10 % 3) # Displays the remainder of 10/3 
print(10 * 3) # 10*3
print(10 ** 3) # 10^3

# Comparision 
x = 3 > 2
print(x)
# '=' is for assignment
# '==' is for equating
# '!=' if for not equals

# Logical
price = 25
print(price > 10 & price < 20) # And is performing multiplication in boolean algebra
print(price > 10 | price < 20) # Or is performing addition in boolean algebra
print(not price > 10) # Not is inverse in boolean algebra
